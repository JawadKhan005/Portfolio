    <h2>Who I am?</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a passionate Software Engineering student, currently pursuing my degree at the renowned Pak-Austria Fachhochschule Institute of Applied Science and Technology.
    </p>
    <p>My academic journey commenced with a strong foundation in programming, starting with a deep dive into the intricacies of C++ during my first semester. In my second semester, I further expanded my knowledge by mastering the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). In my third semester, I successfully completed Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in C++, further enhancing my programming proficiency.</p>
      <p>My interest in web development led me to explore a variety of tools and languages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js, Node.js, PHP, MySQL, Git and Github. I have successfully applied these skills in multiple web development projects during my internships.</p>
      <p>I kick-started my professional journey with an internship at Sabzland, followed by a remote web development internship at Oasis Infobyte. These experiences allowed me to develop hands-on skills in creating user-friendly, responsive websites. I further honed my skills during my recent internship at Entechin, where I contributed to both web and software development projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and C++.</p>
      <p>Beyond technical skills, I am committed to continuous learning and staying at the forefront of the ever-evolving software engineering landscape. I am excited to contribute to the tech industry, leveraging my expertise in web development and software solutions.</p>
      <p>I have make different semester projects in my BS degree till now like:
            Grocery Store Management System ( by using OOP),
            Car Parking Management System ( by using C++),
            Student Marks Management System ( by using C++),
            PDF to Word Convertor ( by using Python).
            </p>
    <p>
      I have done my internship in game development at X-Up Studio with Mind Storm Gaming Company and created many mobile and PC games like:
            Multiple car racing gamr for PC and car douge game for android.
      </p>
      <p>
      I am also a good Football player. I played for PFA( Punjab Football Association), I also won many trophys in it.
